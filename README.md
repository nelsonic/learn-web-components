## tl;dr

We first started hearing about Web Components in
([2013 Google IO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqULJBBEVQE))
but decided they were "***not ready***" (only [Chrome Dev build](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/canary.html) and [Firefox "Nightly"](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) were supporting them back then and
we were stuck in the "*real world*" ... having *support* people using
[*Internet Explorer*](https://www.google.com/?#q=internet+explorer+must+die)!)

Then in [**2014 Addy Osmani *Reminded***](https://youtu.be/GOPXVLxp9Nc)
us about the progress that [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) has made [@LXJS](https://twitter.com/lxjs) and we were *excited* again!

But... then we got stuck working for a "Big Company" (*again*) which meant
that trying new ("risky") things was off the menu... :weary:

Fast forward to March 2015 and we have
[***a chance to build something from scratch***](https://github.com/dwyl)
which means we get to do some:

(sorry, I couldn't resist putting in a tongue-in-cheek-image)

But seriously, we need to assess the available options for technology
*before* releasing our product. Because once we have people using it,
we will no longer have time to go "back to the drawing board"...
