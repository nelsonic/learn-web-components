### History

We first started hearing about Web Components in 2013
([Google IO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqULJBBEVQE))
but decided they were "***not ready***"  
(only [Chrome Dev build](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/canary.html)
  and [Firefox "Nightly"](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) were supporting them
  back then and we were stuck in the  
  "*real world*" ... having *support* people using
  [*Internet Explorer*](https://www.google.com/?#q=internet+explorer+must+die)!)
